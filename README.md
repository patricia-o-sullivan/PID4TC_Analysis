Classification of tasks using pressure insoles. 20 subjects carried out 5 tasks while wearing loadsol pressure insoles: manual handling, pick and place, assembly, walking and standing. Time and frequency domain features are extracted from raw force data (also publicly available) to create new data bases of varied window lengths - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 15 seconds. The databases can be classified using random forest classifier across the windows with the attached code. 83% accuracy was achieved for a 5 second window.

This repository contains the (1.) Databases of extracted features for each subject and time window, and (2.) The analysis code.
